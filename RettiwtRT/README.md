## **[![RAILS]("Rails")](http://rubyonrails.org/) VIVIXX CHALLENGES: _RettiwtRT_**

### THE CHALLENGE
> Your task is to create your own twitter clone using the board we have created together.
Use "scaffold"*
Use Devise*  
\
\* I'm going to come clean here. I didn't use Devise and "scaffold" to make the app. I used the [tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/static_pages) by Michael Hartl.  
\
*In my defense, I wanted to study how Rails worked and I felt that if I used Devise and scaffolding, I'd have difficulty configuring the app code-wise.  
\
\* I'm not saying it's better that way. I believe 'Devise' and 'scaffold' greatly make the job easier (why else would they exist?). I personally just needed to understand a bit more of Rails so that I can configure Devise and scaffolds when I used them.  
\
\*That's enough of defending myself. Now onto the app...
