## **[![RAILS]("Rails")](http://rubyonrails.org/) VIVIXX CHALLENGES: _![]() Taxi Tour Guide_**

### THE CHALLENGE

> Create an app to pitch for a start up.

#### THE IDEA

I guess it's important to know that this idea came up in Baguio City, Philippines. Baguio is a pretty common tourist location, so having tour guides here is not too difficult to imagine.

The premise is that taxi drivers surely must know their way around the city. And they have vehicles, so transporting tourists around shouldn't be a problem. There'll also be no problem with time wasted on the road, as the drivers know routes to make travel faster.

Having taxi drivers as tour guides here in Baguio is not new (as my partner Reggie told me). It just that it happens by chance mostly. That is, they get hailed by a tourist who happens to want to have a tour of the city. With the help of this app, drivers won't have to rely on chance alone, as they will have a chance to present themselves as the tour guide to hire.

### THE APP

![]()

The Taxi Tour Guide App allows taxi drivers to serve as tour guides for tourists in the area. Using this app, drivers will be able to present themselves as tourguides. Think of it as a directory of taxi drivers willing to tour visitors around the city.
