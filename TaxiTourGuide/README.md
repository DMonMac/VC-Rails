## **[![RAILS]("Rails")](http://rubyonrails.org/) VIVIXX CHALLENGES: _![]() Taxi Tour Guide_**

### THE CHALLENGE

> Create an app to pitch for a start up.

### THE IDEA

I guess it's important to know that this idea came up in Baguio City, Philippines. Baguio is a pretty common tourist location, so having tour guides here is not too difficult to imagine.

The premise is that taxi drivers surely must know their way around the city. And they have vehicles, so transporting tourists around shouldn't be a problem. There'll also be no problem with time wasted on the road, as the drivers know routes to make travel faster.

Having taxi drivers as tour guides here in Baguio is not new (as my partner Reggie Cabutotan told me). It just that it happens by chance mostly. That is, they get hailed by a tourist who happens to want to have a tour of the city. With the help of this app, drivers won't have to rely on chance alone, as they will have a chance to present themselves as _the_ tour guide to hire.

### THE APP

![Home Page]()

The Taxi Tour Guide App allows taxi drivers to serve as tour guides for tourists in the area. Using this app, drivers will be able to present themselves as tour guides. Think of it as a directory of taxi drivers willing to tour visitors around the city.

#### FEATURES
- [As a Tourist]()
- [As a Tour Guide]()
#### Tourist or Taxi Tour Guide?
Firstly, you can decide to be either a tourist or a tour guide.

![Tourist?]() ![Taxi Tour Guide?]()

- #### As a Tourist
    Mainly, you'll be able to view the contact details of the Taxi Tour Guides who've signed up in the app.

    - #### Tourist's view:

        ![Tourist Contact View]()

    - #### Guest's view:

        ![Guest Contact View]()

    Notice that those who don't log in to the app won't be able to see the contact details.

- #### As a Taxi Tour Guide
    A Taxi Tour Guide has more work to do on the app as they will have to fix their profile which will be viewed by users of the app. With the sign up alone, there are a lot of details the Taxi Tour Guide has to fill in.

    - #### Tourist's Sign Up page:

        ![Tourist Sign Up]()

    - #### Taxi Tour Guide's Sign Up Page:

        ![Taxi Tour Guide Sign Up]()

    - #### TTG Profile Page

        The Taxi Tour Guide's Profile page will look like this:

        ![TTGProfilePage]()

        The initial idea for the profile was that the Taxi Tour Guide will be able to add tourist spots which will be part of his/her 'itinerary.'

        ![New Spot]()

        ![Itinerary in Profile]()

        The Tourist Spot would also have it's own 'profile page' giving a brief description of the location.

        ![Spot Profile]()

        The idea is that the Taxi Tour Guides would have the opportunity to "show off" their knowledge about the tourists spots, and that would give them somewhat an edge over the other Taxi Tour Guides*.

        > \* When this was presented though, it was suggested that instead of individual locations, it would be much simpler if the taxi drivers we're just to present their route and the time to complete the route as the Tourists pay them per hour. I realized then that that was a good idea, so I plan to add that when my abilities in coding allow me to do so.

### FUTURE PLANS
